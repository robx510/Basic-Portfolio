  <p>My name is Robert Sayavong I'm currently working for Brand Energy Services as an industrial painter.
    I want to become a web developer because I've always been intrested in coding but was scared to invest the time and money to learn.
    I already have a background in I.T I have a Comptia A+ and Network+ Certifications. Somewhere along the line I lost intrested in doing I.T
    so I decided to do construction because it pays well and I really needed the money but I don't really have a passion for it. It feels more like
    just a job rather then something I love to do. So now I'm making a comeback to I.T but more on the programing side whch I always did as a hobbie
    using html and css but now I wanna learn more. So I cant wait to get into JavaScript and other tougher languages.
    So hopefully by the end of this program I will be a bad ass programmer at a good tech company.  ....On a side not as you can see I'm a huge Michael Jordan fan he's been my hero since I was little.</p>
